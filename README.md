# hello-world
My first coding, it's 2:30 am , I feel confused about coding and I'm a little hungry lol

Well as I said Im new here, I would describe myself egoist but at the same time shy. Im lazy these days. Usually Im afraid and stressed when Im around a lot of people or with  people that I don't know, well that's me right now , Im sure i'll change a lot in the future, I wish so...
